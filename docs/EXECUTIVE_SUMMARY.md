# Executive Summary

The Fairness Audit Playbook provides a standardized, scalable, and rigorous framework for evaluating fairness across all AI systems used or built by the company. It addresses current gaps in consistency, accountability, and risk management by integrating four core components:

1. **Historical Context Assessment**  
   Ensures fairness evaluations are grounded in real-world inequities and domain-specific risks.

2. **Fairness Definition Selection**  
   Aligns fairness goals with business, ethical, and regulatory requirements.

3. **Bias Source Identification**  
   Maps where bias enters the ML lifecycle, enabling targeted interventions.

4. **Fairness Metrics Framework**  
   Provides quantitative evidence of disparities across sensitive and intersectional groups.

The playbook is designed for broad adoption across engineering teams, requiring minimal fairness expertise for most use cases. It includes templates, workflows, validation guidance, and a complete example audit.

## Business Impact
