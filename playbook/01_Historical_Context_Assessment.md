\# Historical Context Assessment



\## Purpose

Historical context ensures fairness evaluations are grounded in real‑world inequities, domain‑specific risks, and the lived experiences of impacted groups.



\## Workflow



\### Step 1 — Identify Stakeholders

\- Directly impacted users  

\- Indirectly impacted groups  

\- Regulators and auditors  

\- Advocacy groups  



\### Step 2 — Map Historical Inequities

Document:

\- Known discrimination patterns  

\- Structural inequities  

\- Regulatory history  

\- Prior incidents (internal or industry-wide)  



\### Step 3 — Identify Sensitive \& Intersectional Attributes

Examples:

\- Race  

\- Gender  

\- Age  

\- Disability  

\- Socioeconomic status  

\- Intersectional combinations (e.g., Black women over 40)



\### Step 4 — Assess Potential Harms

\- Allocation harms  

\- Quality-of-service harms  

\- Representational harms  



\### Step 5 — Produce a Context Summary

A one-page document including:

\- Key inequities  

\- High-risk groups  

\- Relevant regulations  

\- Potential harm pathways  



\## Output

A documented historical context report that informs fairness definition selection.
