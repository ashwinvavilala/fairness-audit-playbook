\# Fairness Metrics Framework

\## Purpose

Provide a standardized set of metrics aligned with the selected fairness definition and identified bias sources.

\## Workflow

\### Step 1 — Select Metrics Based on Fairness Definition

Examples:

\- Demographic Parity → Selection Rate Ratio

\- Equalized Odds → TPR/FPR parity

\- Predictive Parity → PPV parity

\- Calibration → Reliability curves

\### Step 2 — Compute Metrics Across:

\- Sensitive attributes

\- Intersectional subgroups

\- Temporal slices

\- Model versions

\### Step 3 — Establish Thresholds

Use:

\- Regulatory standards

\- Industry benchmarks

\- Internal risk tolerance

\### Step 4 — Visualize Results

Recommended:

\- Disparity heatmaps

\- Intersectional fairness matrices

\- Error rate decomposition charts

\### Step 5 — Summarize Findings

Include:

\- Key disparities

\- High-risk groups

\- Confidence intervals

\- Data quality caveats

\## Output

A metrics report that feeds into mitigation planning.
