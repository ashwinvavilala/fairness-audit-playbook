\# Fairness Audit Playbook

\### Introduction \& Overview

\## 1. Purpose

The Fairness Audit Playbook provides a unified, repeatable, and rigorous process for evaluating fairness across all AI systems used or built by the company. It standardizes fairness assessments across teams and ensures alignment with ethical, regulatory, and business goals.

\## 2. Motivation

The company currently faces:

\- Inconsistent fairness evaluations

\- Lack of centralized tools

\- Growing internal and external scrutiny

\- Risk of systemic bias in deployed AI systems

This playbook solves these issues by providing:

\- A standardized audit workflow

\- Clear decision points

\- Domain‑agnostic templates

\- Practical implementation guidance

\- Built‑in intersectional fairness considerations

\## 3. High-Level Workflow

The fairness audit process follows a structured, repeatable sequence designed to guide teams from initial scoping to final validation and documentation.

1. **Define Audit Scope**  
   Identify the model, use case, stakeholders, intended outcomes, and risk level. Confirm business context and regulatory considerations.

2. **Assess Historical Context**  
   Document relevant societal inequities, domain‑specific risks, and impacted groups. Identify potential sources of harm and structural bias.

3. **Select Fairness Definitions**  
   Choose fairness criteria aligned with business goals, ethical principles, and compliance needs. Document trade‑offs and rationale.

4. **Identify Bias Sources**  
   Map where bias may enter the ML lifecycle (data, labeling, modeling, deployment). Use the bias map template to capture risks and assumptions.

5. **Apply Fairness Metrics**  
   Select appropriate metrics based on the chosen fairness definition. Evaluate disparities across sensitive and intersectional groups. Summarize findings using the metrics report template.

6. **Develop Mitigation Strategies**  
   Propose interventions (data, model, process, or governance changes). Prioritize actions based on feasibility and impact.

7. **Validate and Document**  
   Use the validation checklist to ensure completeness and reproducibility. Compile the final audit report using the audit report template.

8. **Review and Iterate**  
   Share findings with stakeholders. Integrate lessons learned into future model development cycles. Update the audit as the model evolves or new risks emerge.
