\# Bias Source Identification

\## Purpose

Identify where bias enters the ML lifecycle so teams can target interventions effectively.

\## Workflow

\### Step 1 — Data Bias Analysis

Check for:

\- Representation gaps

\- Labeling inconsistencies

\- Historical bias in labels

\- Sampling bias

\- Missingness patterns

\### Step 2 — Model Bias Analysis

Evaluate:

\- Feature importance

\- Proxy variables

\- Model architecture limitations

\- Sensitivity to subgroup distributions

\### Step 3 — Pipeline \& Deployment Bias

Assess:

\- Drift

\- Feedback loops

\- Human-in-the-loop inconsistencies

\- Third-party model risks

\### Step 4 — Intersectional Bias Mapping

For each subgroup:

\- Representation

\- Error rates

\- Feature interactions

\### Step 5 — Produce a Bias Map

Include:

\- Bias source

\- Severity

\- Impacted groups

\- Evidence

\- Recommended mitigations

\## Output

A bias map that informs metric selection and mitigation planning.
